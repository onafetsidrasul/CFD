# CFD final exam
### Lid driven cavity
The first simulation regards a 2d lid driven cavity with different Reynolds. Results are compared with _C. T. Shin, U. Ghia, K. N. Ghia., “High-Re Solutions for Incompressible Flow Using the Navier-Stokes
Equations and a Multigrid Method”. In: Journal of Computational Physics 48 (1982)_.
### Poiseuille flow
Then I implement a Poiseuille flow in 2d, comparing the obtained horizontal velocity along a vertical line with the analytical solution.
## Airfoil
### Boundary layer
To look at how the Reynolds number and $x$ act on the thickness of boundary layer, I also run simulations with different $\nu$.
### Recirculation
At this point I look at the effect of recirculation on the foil when tilting it.
### Bernoulli equation
In the end I test the validity of Bernoully equation.
